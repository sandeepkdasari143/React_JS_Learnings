	-> What are the other ways to export the file.

-> There are two ways to export and import any React Functional Component, they are:
	
	1. Exporting & Importing by Name.
		e.g., `export const Title = ({...props}) => {
					return(
						<Logo />
					);
				};`

		-> Named Import is looks like => `import {Title} form './components/Header';`

	2. Exporting & Importing by Default
		e.g., `const Header = () => {
					return(
						<>
							<Title />
							<NavBar />
						</>
					);
				};
				export default Header;`

		-> Default Import is looks like => `import Header form './components/Header';`


-> We can import everything as => `import * as Obj from './components/Header'; `
